## 📚 [**View Full Documentation →**](https://mathis-m.github.io/fluent-plus/)

FluentPlus is a comprehensive component library built on top of [Fluent UI v9](https://react.fluentui.dev) that extends and enhances the capabilities of Microsoft's design system. Our library is designed to bridge gaps in the Fluent UI ecosystem while providing powerful, customizable solutions for complex business applications.

## Features

- � **Fill Fluent UI gaps** - Core components that extend v9's component catalog
- ⚙️ **Complex frameworks** - Multi-component solutions for specialized business needs
- 🚀 **Pre-built assemblies** - High-level components for rapid application development
- 🎨 **Design system alignment** - Full compatibility with Fluent UI v9 principles and theming
- ⚡ **Enterprise-ready** - Powerful, customizable solutions for complex business applications
- 🔗 **Seamless integration** - Built with Fluent UI v9's API patterns and design language

## Our Mission

FluentPlus serves as a strategic extension to Fluent UI v9, offering components and frameworks that either aren't yet available in Fluent UI v9 or provide specialized functionality for enterprise-level applications. We maintain full compatibility with Fluent UI's design principles, API patterns, and theming system while adding the flexibility and features modern applications demand.

## Component Philosophy

Our library is organized into three distinct categories, each serving specific development needs and use cases:

### 🔧 Core Components
Fundamental components that could be part of Fluent UI v9 but aren't yet available. Highly customizable building blocks designed with Fluent UI v9's API patterns and design principles.

### ⚙️ Framework Components  
Complex and feature-rich frameworks consisting of multiple components for specific use cases. Low-level components and utilities that allow for high customizability and serve specific business needs.

### 🚀 High-Level Components
Opinionated high-level assemblies of framework components. Pre-built solutions that combine multiple components for common business scenarios and rapid development.

Whether you're looking to fill gaps in Fluent UI's component catalog, implement complex business workflows, or rapidly prototype with pre-built solutions, FluentPlus provides the tools you need while maintaining the familiar Fluent design language your users expect.
