# FluentPlus

FluentPlus is a component library built on top of Microsoft Fluent UI v9, providing higherâ€‘level, opinionated, and readyâ€‘toâ€‘use components. It helps teams move faster by extending the Fluent design system with common patterns, composite widgets, and productivityâ€‘focused abstractions.

## Overview

FluentPlus enhances the Fluent UI v9 ecosystem by offering a set of higherâ€‘level building blocks that go beyond the base components. Instead of starting from scratch with primitives, you can leverage FluentPlus for:

- **Composite components** - Preâ€‘built combinations of Fluent controls
- **Readyâ€‘toâ€‘use patterns** - Forms, navigation, dialogs, layouts, and more
- **Consistent design extensions** - Aligned with Fluent's look and feel
- **Developerâ€‘friendly abstractions** - Reduce boilerplate and speed up development

FluentPlus is not a replacement for Fluent UI â€” it's an opinionated extension layer designed to make application development smoother and more efficient.
