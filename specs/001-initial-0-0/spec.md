## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a React developer building applications with Fluent UI v9, I want to use a file upload components from FluentPlus so that I can provide users with modern, accessible file upload experiences. I want to fully control the state externally, the FluentPlus component should only focus on the UI/UX for the initial release.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a developer needs basic file upload functionality, **When** they install @fluent-plus/file-upload@0.0.1 or @fluent-plus/react-components@0.0.1, **Then** they can import and use FileUpload, FileList, and FileItem components with full TypeScript support

2. **Given** a user visits an application using FluentPlus file upload components, **When** they drag files onto the upload area, **Then** the dropzone provides immediate visual feedback and accepts the files

3. **Given** a user has selected files for upload, **When** they view the file list, **Then** each file displays with name, size, and status in a consistent, accessible interface

4. **Given** a developer wants to customize file upload behavior, **When** they implement their own state management around the core components, **Then** they can build exactly the upload experience they need using the flexible component architecture

5. **Given** a user interacts with file upload components using only keyboard navigation, **When** they navigate through all interactive elements, **Then** all functionality is accessible with proper focus indicators and screen reader announcements

6. **Given** a developer integrates FluentPlus with their existing Fluent UI v9 application, **When** they implement file upload components, **Then** the components seamlessly match their application's theme and design tokens


## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

**Core Component Architecture**
- **FR-001**: Library MUST provide three independent, composable components: FileUpload, FileList, and FileItem
- **FR-002**: Each component MUST follow Fluent UI v9's slot-based architecture pattern for maximum customization
- **FR-003**: Components MUST be usable independently or together based on developer needs
- **FR-004**: Library MUST provide TypeScript definitions for all components and hooks

**FileUpload Component**
- **FR-005**: FileUpload MUST support drag-and-drop file selection with visual feedback states
- **FR-006**: FileUpload MUST provide click-to-browse functionality as secondary interaction method
- **FR-007**: FileUpload MUST accept files through both drag-and-drop and click interactions
- **FR-008**: FileUpload MUST provide slots for label, description, dropzone, trigger button, and hidden input
- **FR-009**: FileUpload MUST integrate with react-dropzone for robust cross-browser drag-and-drop support

**FileList Component**
- **FR-010**: FileList MUST serve as a container for displaying multiple FileItem components
- **FR-011**: FileList MUST support both div and ul element types for semantic flexibility
- **FR-012**: FileList MUST work with any file data source and not impose data structure requirements

**FileItem Component**
- **FR-013**: FileItem MUST display file information including name, size, and status
- **FR-014**: FileItem MUST provide slots for beforeContent, status, content, progressIndicator, actions, and afterContent
- **FR-015**: FileItem MUST support file removal functionality when onRemove callback is provided
- **FR-016**: FileItem MUST display upload progress when progress information is available
- **FR-017**: FileItem MUST show error messages for file-specific validation or upload failures

**Accessibility & Standards**
- **FR-018**: All components MUST support full keyboard navigation using Tab, Enter, and Space keys
- **FR-019**: All components MUST provide appropriate ARIA labels, roles, and live regions for screen readers
- **FR-020**: All components MUST be compatible with high contrast mode
- **FR-021**: All components MUST provide clear focus indicators for keyboard navigation
- **FR-022**: Components MUST announce status changes to screen readers through live regions

**Design System Integration**
- **FR-023**: All components MUST use Fluent UI v9 design tokens for consistent theming
- **FR-024**: Components MUST follow Fluent 2 design principles for visual design
- **FR-025**: Components MUST integrate seamlessly with existing Fluent UI v9 applications
- **FR-026**: Components MUST support all Fluent UI v9 theme customizations

**Package & Distribution**
- **FR-027**: Library MUST be published as scoped packages following Fluent UI patterns: @fluent-plus/file-upload@0.0.1 for the component package
- **FR-028**: Library MUST provide a re-export package @fluent-plus/react-components@0.0.1 for convenient imports
- **FR-029**: Each package MUST include CommonJS and ES modules builds
- **FR-030**: Each package MUST include TypeScript declaration files
- **FR-031**: Each package MUST declare peer dependencies on required Fluent UI v9, React and potentially other packages if appropriate
- **FR-032**: The storybook for the new library `file-upload` MUST be created in full detail showcasing all components, states, variations, and slots as done for Fluent UI v9.

### Key Entities

n/A - The core components will only work through slots and props. All information and behaviour is configured in this way.
